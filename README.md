### Credits
* I learned most of this python code and version control information from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
* I found a way to concatenate columns in a dataframe [here](https://datatofish.com/concatenate-values-python/).
* I found a way to use an _OR_ in an `if` statement [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp).
* I found a way to see if _type_ was `dict` [here](https://stackabuse.com/python-check-if-variable-is-a-dictionary/).
